# React-Customerservice-app

**React-CustomerService-App** is a frontend application for the customer management project, developed with React. It is designed to facilitate the registration and management of customer data in a distributed system using microservices.

## :clipboard: Requirements

> **Note:**  
> To run this project, you need:
>
>- **Node.js** version 22.14.0 or higher
>- **npm** (Node.js package manager)
>- You need to have followed the complete setup instructions for the **Eureka Service Discovery** and **Customer Service** projects.

## :gear: Project Configuration

**Set up Eureka Service Discovery and Customer Service**:  
   To run this project, you must first complete the setup instructions for **Service Discovery** and **Customer Service**. Detailed instructions can be found at the following links:
   - **Service Discovery**: [Instructions here](https://github.com/AndresMaldonado200338/Eureka-Service-Discovery)
   - **Customer Service**: [Instructions here](https://github.com/AndresMaldonado200338/Customer-Service)

2. **Create and configure the `.env` file**:  
   Once both services are set up correctly, create a `.env` file following the format of the provided `.env.example` file.
   
   In this `.env` file, add the microservice path shown in **Eureka Service Discovery** in the section **'Instances currently registered with Eureka'**. This is necessary so the frontend can access the microservices using the addresses provided by Eureka.

   Example:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9092
    ```
